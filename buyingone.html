<h3>there are surprisingly many ways to ge a bike these days, the internet and all.
here are what i think is the 3 best ways to buy a bike<h3>
<ol>
<li>Buying from a shop: This way is always very good as professionals can fit you
into the optimal bike for your riding style. this is very important because when a bike is 
to big it hurts your back and makes you prone to injuries in your back and neck. If a bike 
is too small, your form will be messed up, opening up the possibility to knee injuries. Which
is never good. Its also just a very uncomfortable riding experience. While your there, you could also 
purchase all the necessary 
accessories that you will need. the downside is that buying from a bike store could be a bit expensive.</li>

<li>Buying online: Just order online and have it delivered to you! So simple,so easy. You have to be a
bit careful where you buy the bike as you cant inspect or ride the bike before buying. 
You could use online measurement services to figure out what size bike is perfect for you. Overall,
buying online could be a very good method in getting a bike. Its also a bit cheaper.</li>

<li>Craigslist: Why buy new? search for what you need on craigslist and find your perfect bike! 
Its the cheepest method as used bikes value goes down drastically. People selling bikes on craigslist 
aren't usually looking for a profit so you could get a awesome deal on a bike. The downside is that
craigslist purchases could be a bit risky as it involves a lot of trust between buyer and seller</li>
