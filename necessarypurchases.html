<h2>Even after buying a bike, you still need to buy some necessary accessories. You can either 
buy them online or at store. Both very good options.<h2>

<ol>
<li>Helmet: You need a helmet because, well...duh.</li>

<li>Lock: If you are planning to travel places or get to work, you need a lock to 
make sure your bike does not get stolen. Some locks are more secure and expensive than others.
A good rule of thumb is buying a lock that is 1/10 what you payed for the bike.</il>

<li>Lights: If you are planning to ride your bike at night in the dark, you need some lights
to alert the cars around you that you are there.</il>

<li>Bike pump: Those wheels wont be perfectly pumped forever. Think ahead and buy a bike pump</li>
